## Project Overview

This project is a part of the Holberton School curriculum and covers various tasks related to using sets and dictionaries in Python. It includes exercises and challenges to help you improve your understanding of these data structures and their applications.

## Files in this Repository

- [0-square_matrix_simple.py](0-square_matrix_simple.py): A function that computes the square value of all integers in a matrix using a new list.
- [1-search_replace.py](1-search_replace.py): A function that replaces all occurrences of an element in a list with another element.
- [2-uniq_add.py](2-uniq_add.py): A function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once).
- [3-common_elements.py](3-common_elements.py): A function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
- [4-only_diff_elements.py](4-only_diff_elements.py): A function that returns a set of all elements present in one set but not in another.

- [102-complex_delete.py](102-complex_delete.py): A function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
- [103-python.c](103-python.c): A C program that prints basic information about Python lists, Python bytes objects, and Python float objects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine and review the files and their descriptions. Each Python script has a specific task, and you can run them individually to see the results.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x04-python-more_data_structures.git
cd 0x04-python-more_data_structures
python3 0-square_matrix_simple.py

Usage
Please refer to the individual script files for usage examples and detailed explanations of each task.

Contributing
Contributions are not expected for this project as it is part of a learning curriculum. However, if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to contact the author.
