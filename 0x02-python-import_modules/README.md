## Introduction

In Python, modules are files containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` added. This project will cover various aspects of modules and imports, including:

- Importing modules and specific objects from modules.
- Creating your own modules.
- Organizing code using modular programming techniques.

By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of how to structure and organize your Python code using modules and imports.
