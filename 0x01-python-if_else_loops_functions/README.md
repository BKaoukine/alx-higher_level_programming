# Python Fundamentals: If/Else, Loops, and Functions

## Overview
This directory contains Python scripts and examples that cover fundamental concepts in Python programming. These concepts include if/else statements, loops, and functions. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this directory is a great place to start.

## Table of Contents
1. [If/Else Statements](./if_else)
   - Learn how to make decisions in your Python programs with if and else statements.
   
2. [Loops](./loops)
   - Explore different types of loops, such as for loops and while loops, to iterate through data or perform repetitive tasks.
   
3. [Functions](./functions)
   - Understand how to define and use functions to encapsulate code and make your programs more modular and readable.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the subdirectories for each of these fundamental topics. Each subdirectory contains Python scripts and explanations to help you grasp the core concepts.

## How to Run the Code
To run the Python scripts in this directory, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Navigate to the specific topic directory you want to explore (if_else, loops, or functions).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4. Run the Python script using the `python` command. For example:
                    `python if_else_example.py`
